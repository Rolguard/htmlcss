                <p>
                    Heyo guys! I'm Andrew Sugito, a 2nd year student studying Commerce & Computer Science at
                    the University of New South Wales (UNSW).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I graduated from Sydney Technical High School in 2020 and participated in various activities
                    throughout high school. I played volleyball knockouts and other tournaments such as the Schools Cup
                    for my high school team as an opposite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9wnsdksLg&t=435s"
                        target="_blank">(R.I.P Carlos)</a>.
                    Definitely was super fun and many great moments with the team but too bad we never won a tournament
                    ðŸ˜­...
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    On a brighter note, I also enjoyed my time as an Australian Air Force Cadet for 324 SQN City of
                    Randwick, reaching the rank of Leading Cadet. Some cool activities I did as a cadet included drill
                    (following instructions with a group of fellow cadets such as marching, saluting), fieldcraft and
                    bivouac activities (building survival shelters, practicing camouflage, roasting marshmallows at
                    night...).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>"What am I doing right now?" Hmm.. not too much really.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Besides tumbling in uni work, I help with presenting and mentoring coding workshops to high schools
                    via CompClub, tutoring maths for primary school students, playing social volleyball for a couple
                    of
                    clubs and dabbling in League, Valorant and any other interesting games I find my hands on.

                <div class="recommend-txt">
                    <p>While I played this game on the Nintendo DS a long time ago, I revisited it in recent years using
                        DeSmuME emulator playing a more DLC version called PokÃ©mon Mystery Dungeon (PMD): Explorers of Sky but overall they're the same game.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The action in the game is turn-based which can immediately be a turn-off for some but PMD breaks some of the monotonous grinding with large variety in regular and boss monsters and miscellaneous events such as Monster House and Kelecon's Shop.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Despite the combat being quite engaging, I think the main strength of this game is in the diversity of personalities, character development and engaging storytelling. But I won't be the first to admit that nostalgia from childhood may have severely clouded my judgement. At least, if you're a fan of RPGs, PMD will definitely be an enjoyable play.

            <h2>Stardew Valley</h2>

                <div class="recommend-txt">
                    <p>Firstly, I want to lead off that the initial start of Stardey Valley was made by ONE single developer. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone programmed all the farming mechanics, designed all the character models whilst simultaneously integrating already-polished parts into a seamless and warm storyline of escaping the dullness of city life.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Stardew Valley presents colourful but also realistic characters each with their own motivations and struggles. What separates Stardew Valley from a game like PMD, is that players connect on a greater level as many empathise with the dread of office work and wish for a refreshing escape, particularly within nature. While I think that this game is best played solo (at least for your 1st playthrough), multiplayer options are available, building possibilities to build connections with the villagers, fish, mine and farm with your friends too.

            <h2>Slay the Spire</h2>
            <section>
                <div class="recommend-div">

                        alt="Slay the Spire Steam Front Page">
                </div>

                <div class="recommend-txt">
                    <p>This one is a definite banger and I know the deck-building / card-game genre will immediately push people off of this game but trust me... give it a go. I played the majority of my hours with only the three characters, Ironclad, Silent, Defect but they fairly recently released Watcher character which I tried a bit and looks pretty broken. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        With plenty of "question mark" events, various elite and end level bosses each with their own special mechanics make learning this game extremely rewarding. Many bosses encourage completely different playstyles so even if you use the same deck, gameplay is exceptionally diverse.
                        On top of various builds for characters like strength/block-stacking on Ironclad, shiv and poison builds on Silent and orb mechanics with Defect, replayability is further reinforced, passing Slay the Spire as one of my favourite roguelite's of all time.
